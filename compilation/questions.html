<div class="section">
  <div class="wrap">
    <div class="col-six">
      <p><strong><em>What are the prerequisites?</em></strong></p>
      <p>You need to be 16 or older and have completed at least 3 college courses or exams.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Can I take more than one course at the same time?</em></strong></p>
      <p>Leadership Theory and Practice and Leadership and Management Communications can be taken simultaneously.</p>

      <p><strong><em>How is credit awarded?</em></strong></p>
      <p>When you complete any of these courses, you will receive credit through Bryan College, a highly ranked, degree-granting institution in TN. Bryan College is regionally accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>

      <p>Since Bryan College is fully accredited, credits easily transfer to most schools. Once you complete the course, a grade and credit awarded will be placed on an official transcript. You may then request a transcript be sent to the school of your choice.</p>

      <p>Please note that each academic institution has different credit acceptance policies. It is highly recommended that you confirm with your respective college whether a course will apply to your degree.</p>

      <p><strong><em>How do the three parties work together on these courses?</em></strong></p>
      <p>CollegePlus! has partnered with Dr. Jeff Myers of Bryan College and Summit Ministries to develop and deliver the Signature Leadership Course Series. The content is provided and taught by Dr. Myers, delivered through the CollegePlus! learning site, and awarded credit through Bryan College. Any administrative questions can be directed to CollegePlus!, who is responsible for most administrative details relating to the management of the course.</p>

      <p><strong><em>What is the cost?</em></strong></p>
      <p>Each course regularly costs $797. CollegePlus! students are eligible for a scholarship, bringing the cost to only $597. These prices reflect registrations created before the Early Registration Deadline for each semester.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-six">
      <p><strong><em>What is the refund policy?</em></strong></p>
      <p>If a student chooses to withdraw from the course before the registration deadline is reached, a 75% refund will be issued. If a student withdraws after the registration deadline but at least two weeks before the course begins, a 50% refund will be issued. If a student withdraws less than two weeks before the course begins, a 25% refund will be issued. No refund is available after the course has begun.</p>

      <p><strong><em>How does the online system work?</em></strong></p>
      <p>Each Leadership Course is available through a CollegePlus! administered system known as a Learning Management System. This online, user-friendly, course software will make each step of accessing and submitting coursework easy and enjoyable. You will be given a unique login and have the opportunity to personalize your own ‘workspace.’ All resources you will need for the course will be available through the online site.</p>

      <p><strong><em>How much time is required each week?</em></strong></p>
      <p>As an upper-level course, you can expect to spend about 15 hours on your studies a week.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Is there any certain time of day or day of the week that I have to be online to attend live lectures?</em></strong></p>
      <p>There will be live webinars with other students or Dr. Myers two to three times during the semester. If you are unable to make the time specified, you may request permission to listen to the recording rather than attending the live event.</p>
