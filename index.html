      <p>The ability to influence and lead is a skill all college grads must possess to thrive in the emerging knowledge-based economy. Employers demand it and entrepreneurs need it.</p>
      <p>CollegePlus and Dr. Jeff Myers have teamed up to create an accredited leadership course that prepares you to successfully lead a business, a ministry, and a family.</p>
      <p>Each course is worth 3 college credits. And each course is designed to launch you from college and into life as an influential leader.</p>
